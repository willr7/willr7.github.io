                <h2>Motivation</h2>
                <p>Our mission is to address the issue of poverty in the Black community in Boston. There are countless causes behind this issue, and the effects can be seen everywhere from housing to healthcare. The issue of poverty is especially prominent in Black communities, and it can be seen by the extreme disparity between the average household net worth of Black households vs White households, as seen in this study: The Color of Wealth in Boston.</p>

                <h2>Event Summary</h2>
                <p>In order to address this issue, we present the Bridge The Gap Hackathon (BTG Hack), a hackathon where students can come together for a weekend to create technical solutions to address the issue of poverty in the Black community in Boston. Our goal is to give students the opportunity to develop their skills while benefiting their local community.</p>
                <p>We want to help students create real solutions that will actually have an impact. In order to do this, we will give students the resources that they need to fully turn their ideas into reality. This will include providing funding, and connecting students to mentors who have experience dealing with this issue.</p>

                <h2>Logistics</h2>
                <p>The hackathon will take place from September 20th-22nd. The opening ceremony will begin on Friday the 20th at 6pm in the Mezzanine Lounge in the MIT Stratton Student Center, and hacking will begin at 8pm. Students will have until 8am on Sunday the 22nd to submit their projects, and then we will have two rounds of judging to determine 3 grand prize winners.</p>
